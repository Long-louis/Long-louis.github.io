Hello! I am currently a first-year graduate student at the School of Mathematics, Harbin Institute of Technology, supervised by Professor Jianwei Ma. My research areas include computer vision and machine learning. My main current research interests focus on the theory and applications of diffusion generative models, as well as interpretability of neural networks, encompassing both theoretical analysis and empirical explanations.

I warmly welcome and encourage active communication and collaboration with anyone who shares similar research interests！
